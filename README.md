# Faster-Sort

Ever since I took my first Data Structures and Algorithms course, I became fascinated with sorting algorithms. And given that sorting algorithms are a dozen a dime, I thought to myself, "Why not create my own?". This project is exactly an attempt at that. If you want the final version of this algorithm scroll all the way to the bottom. But for now, let's start with the seed idea that sparked the new algorithm.

IDEA #1: sorting numbers is faster than sorting strings. So, if we could come up with a way to convert strings to numbers, we could theoratically sort them much faster.

So how do we convert a string to a number?
